			I am currently a software developer at Liberty Mutual. I graduated in 2011 from Penn State with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Spanish. 
			<br>
			In my free time I enjoy volunteering at the SPCA, watching football, and playing volleyball. I am most passionate about running and have completed two half-marathons and a full marathon this year.
