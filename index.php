			I am currently a software developer at Liberty Mutual. I graduated in 2011 from Penn State with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Spanish. I began computer programming when I started my job 2 years ago. I am very excited for this course to expand my knowledge of dynamic web applications and build my own website.

			In my free time I enjoy volunteering at the SPCA, watching football, and playing volleyball. I am most passionate about running and have completed two half-marathons and a full marathon this year. No matter what stress I am going through at the time, a nice run never fails to help clear my head.
			<br>
			The code editor I am using is Sublime Text 2
